# youtube-clone-html-css
A YouTube homepage clone built using HTML and CSS by following a tutorial to practice frontend layout, Flexbox, and UI design fundamentals.


This project is a front-end clone of the YouTube homepage built using HTML5 and CSS3. I created this project by following the tutorial from SuperSimpleDev as part of my web development learning journey.

 About the Project:

The goal of this project was to understand how real-world websites are structured and to practice building clean and responsive layouts using pure HTML and CSS.

This clone replicates:

Fixed header with search bar

Sidebar navigation menu

Video grid layout

Video preview cards (thumbnail, title, channel name, views, duration)

Hover tooltips and UI styling

Technologies Used:
HTML5

CSS3

Flexbox

Google Fonts (Roboto)
